			"I'm a student (currently) in the final year of a bachelor's degree in computer science at Ephec. During my studies, I have acquired skills in networks administration, programming, security and telecommunications, although I prefer application development, artificial intelligence and game design. I really enjoy learning new skills, keeping up to date and discovering new technologies. I'm always there to improve, through success and failure."

			"Hello, my name is Ciamala Kombe Greg, I'm a 22 years old bachelor students who's live in Belgium. I have a lot of hobbies and passions from video games to AI or even web development. In the future, I'd like to learn more about AI and game design, I know, the later doesn't have that much in commons with my bachelor, but hey, not every goals are the same. I thrive to deepen my understanding and knowledge in a lot of domains, it can goes from learning a new programming language to political or spacial subjects.",
		skills:
			"I'm performing in pure web development subjects, mainly in Java, C++, JavaScript and Python. next to this, I'm also quite skilled in network administration but it isn't a work I'm that found of even though I like some aspects of it.",
		project:
			"I still don't know what I'd like to do in the future, not because I lack ideas, but I'm simply not sure of the process to get there. I'm planning to maybe do a Master degree, but again, it comes from my ambition to learn more about AI and game design, probably making one of those two my work. However, I'm still open to go through steps one by one, there is a lot of fields I'd like to test out and even do projects.",
		goodAt:
			"I'm someone who can focus and get the job done when the subject is something I like, I'm also very well organised when given time. I can work in a team as long as there is a calm and friendly atmosphere around us.",
		badAt:
			"But I also know my weakness, I can easily get distracted when something catch my interest, I tend to overdo things that can be done in easier way and I'm also not the most social person, not out of being a 'shut off', but out of being quite reserved to close friends and family."
